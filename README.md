We introduce a novel modeling strategy for analyzing single-cell multi-omics data sourced from various studies. Our approach is driven by the surge in single-cell multi-omics research in biological and medical fields, exemplified by the RNA-protein simultaneous sequencing case-control study on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). To capture the nonlinear relationships between diverse molecular types, including genes and proteins, and to identify both study-shared and study-specific features while accounting for the count nature of the data, we propose a multi-study nonlinear factor model incorporating study-shared and study-specific factors, along with augmented omics variables as covariates.

# Installation
"MultiCOAP" depends on the 'Rcpp' and 'RcppArmadillo' package, which requires appropriate setup of computer. For the users that have set up system properly for compiling C++ files, the following installation command will work.
```{Rmd}
## Method 1ï¼š
if (!require("remotes", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("feiyoung/MultiCOAP")

## Method 2: install from CRAN
install.packages("MultiCOAP")

```
